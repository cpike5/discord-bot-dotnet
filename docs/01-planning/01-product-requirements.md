# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Discord Bot with Web Application Integration

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Overview

A Discord bot integrated with an ASP.NET Core Blazor web application that provides invite-code-based user registration. The bot enables Discord users to request registration codes and links their Discord identity with web application accounts.

## 2. Goals

- Enable Discord-to-Web application user registration flow
- Establish one-to-one mapping between Discord users and web application accounts
- Provide administrative controls for invite code management
- Create a foundation for future Discord bot features

## 3. Target Users

- **Discord Server Members**: Request invite codes to register on the web application
- **Administrators**: Manage invite codes, monitor registrations, and maintain the system

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1 User Registration Flow

**Feature:** Discord users can request invite codes via bot command

**Requirements:**
- User executes `/register` slash command in Discord
- Bot generates a unique invite code (format: `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`)
- Code is sent to user via Direct Message (DM)
- Code includes registration URL and expiration time
- Codes expire after 24 hours
- Codes are single-use only

### 4.2 Web Application Registration

**Feature:** Users register on web application using invite codes

**Requirements:**
- Registration page requires valid invite code
- Code validates against Discord user who requested it
- Successful registration links Discord user ID to Identity account
- One Discord user can only create one web account (one-to-one mapping)
- Invalid/expired/used codes show appropriate error messages

### 4.3 Administrative Commands

**Feature:** Administrators can manage invite codes

**Requirements:**
- `/admin generate-code @user` - Manually generate code for a user
- `/admin revoke-code <code>` - Invalidate an active code
- `/admin list-codes` - View all active invite codes
- Commands restricted to Discord administrators only

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Security
- Invite codes are cryptographically secure random strings
- One Discord user = one active invite code at a time
- Codes cannot be reused after registration
- Prevent invite code enumeration attacks

### 5.2 Performance
- Bot responds to commands within 2 seconds
- Registration validation completes within 1 second
- Background cleanup of expired codes runs daily

### 5.3 Reliability
- Bot auto-reconnects on disconnection
- Failed DMs are handled gracefully with fallback response
- Database transactions ensure data consistency

## 6. Out of Scope (Phase 1)

- Account unlinking/relinking
- Multiple Discord servers support
- Custom expiration times per code
- Email verification integration
- OAuth2 Discord login for web app

## 7. Success Metrics

- Users can successfully complete registration flow
- Zero unauthorized registrations
- Admin commands function correctly
- Bot maintains 99%+ uptime

## 8. Future Considerations

- Web-based admin panel
- Discord server role integration
- Registration analytics dashboard
- Bulk invite code generation
- Custom registration approval workflows
