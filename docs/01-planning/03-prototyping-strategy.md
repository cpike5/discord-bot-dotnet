## Overview

This document outlines the phased approach for prototyping the UI/UX of the Discord bot web application using plain HTML and CSS. The goal is to establish a cohesive visual design language and validate UI patterns before full implementation.

---

## Phase 1: Design Foundation

### Design Tokens
Create a comprehensive design token system that defines:
- **Spacing** - Consistent padding, margins, and gaps
- **Typography** - Font families, sizes, weights, and line heights
- **Sizing** - Component dimensions and breakpoints
- **Layout** - Grid systems and container standards

### Color Tokens
Establish a complete color system including:
- **Brand Colors** - Primary, secondary, and accent palettes
- **Semantic Colors** - Success, warning, error, and info states
- **Theme Support** - Dark and light mode variations
- **Neutral Scales** - Gray scales for backgrounds and borders

---

## Phase 2: Component Prototypes

Using the design tokens from Phase 1, prototype core UI components:

- **Tab Groups** - Navigation tabs and content organization
- **Page Layouts** - Grid systems, containers, and responsive structures
- **Modal Windows** - Dialogs, overlays, and popups
- **Forms** - Input fields, buttons, labels, and validation states

Each component should demonstrate:
- Default state
- Interactive states (hover, focus, active)
- Error/validation states where applicable
- Responsive behavior

---

## Phase 3: Full-Page Prototypes

Build complete page views using the standardized components from Phase 2:

### Core Application Pages
- **User Profile Pages** - View and edit user information
- **Admin Management Pages** - Dashboard, invite code management, user administration
- **Login/Registration Pages** - Authentication and account creation flows
- **Additional Pages** - As needed based on application requirements

Each page prototype should:
- Use consistent design and color tokens
- Incorporate standardized components
- Demonstrate responsive layouts
- Show realistic content and data states

---

## Technical Approach

**Technology Stack:**
- Plain HTML for structure
- Plain CSS for styling
- TailwindCSS via CDN (if needed for rapid prototyping)

**Standards:**
- Consistent application of design tokens across all prototypes
- Semantic HTML markup
- Modular, reusable CSS classes
- Mobile-first responsive design

**Deliverables:**
- Static HTML pages demonstrating UI patterns
- CSS files with design token definitions
- Component library documentation
- Full-page view examples

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Visual Consistency** - Cohesive design language across all prototypes
2. **Reusability** - Components can be easily integrated into the Blazor application
3. **Accessibility** - Proper semantic markup and ARIA attributes where needed
4. **Responsive Design** - Layouts work across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
5. **Developer Reference** - Clear examples for the development team to follow

---

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1 by defining design and color tokens
2. Document token decisions and create CSS variable definitions
3. Move to Phase 2 component prototyping
4. Iterate on components based on feedback
5. Proceed to Phase 3 full-page prototypes
6. Review and refine before implementation in Blazor
